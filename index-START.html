  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // let name = "lauren";
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2); //(lauren, lauren)
    // name = "Bungo"
    // console.log(name, name2) //(Bungo, lauren)
    // unless we tell name2 to = name after name has been redeclared it goes with first definition

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Luna', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); //you get each array

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    console.log(players, team); //both will have last array item as 'Lux' because the second array is in reference to the first
    //any changes made will be made to all, unlike with strings, numbers, and booleans.

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //since it is a REFERENCE it changes original array as well!
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //if we pass no parameters it returns a copy of entire original
    console.log(team2);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; //this is a copy! any changes made will also be made on orig object

    // how do we make a copy instead?
    //pass in empty object, object to assign from, then any key value pairs to update/add
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99});
    console.log(captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const captain3 = {...person}; not in JS yet but will work like array spreading
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    //ie you can still accidentally change the original object at this time even with Object.assign
    // below is the "Poor Mans deep clone" converts to string then back to object making a copy that won't change original object

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
